## Target Audience

Students – The primary users who will interact with the system to register for courses, view their schedules, and manage their academic information. The system should be user-friendly, intuitive, and secure to meet the needs of students with varying levels of technical expertise.

University/College Administrators – Admins who oversee course registration, student data management, and system maintenance. The platform should offer administrative features like course management, enrollment tracking, student data access, and reporting tools.

Parents and Guardians – While not direct users, they may access the system to track the progress or course load of students, especially in the case of younger students in a school environment.
